## Overview:

This program repairs QFX files that suffer from the "FITID NONE" bug that was reported by user JayLo in [this thread][1] the Quicken Community Forurm.  The corrupt QFX files reportedly started downloading on Jan 31 2019 and, as of this writing (Feb 5, 2019) are still appearing.

## Usage:

* Install python (tested with python 3 but python 2 and python 3 should both work) from [here][2].
* Copy fixFitidNone.py to your desktop by *right* clicking on [THIS LINK][4] and selecting "Save Link As...".
* To fix a corrupted QFX file, drop it on the script you just put on your desktop.
* The QFX file will be modified to have unique FITID values where before there were invalid "NONE" values.
* A backup of the original file with the extension ".original" will be created.


## Credits:

* This program is a modified version of [fixChaseFitidNone][3] by hleofxquotes@gmail.com

## Notes:  

The only functional difference between this program and the original fixChaseFitidNone.py program is that the original had a more sophisticated command line syntax and wrote a new output file instead of modifying the existing file.  The output files generated by the two programs should be identical.

Please file a github issue if you run into any problems with this program.
